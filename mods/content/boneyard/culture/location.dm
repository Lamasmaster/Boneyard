	description = "Since the first generation ships were launched almost one hundred years ago, people have been born far out in the voids of space. Being almost entirely self-sustaining, the \
	people living out here often go entirely undetected, with their existence unknown by the greater Human community. With the advent of FTL travel a generation ago, some of these vessels have \
	been reintergrated into Humanity, having developed divergent and strange cultures while in extreme isolation."
